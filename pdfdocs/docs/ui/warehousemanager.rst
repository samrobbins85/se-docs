Warehouse Manager
=========================================================
Access by clicking Warehouse Manager in the side bar.

Overview
--------

When loaded, this page collects all of the zones in the database, as
well as the bays contained within them, and displays them to the user in
an accordion style menu.

On the left is a wheel that displays the percentage of trays filled out
of the total potential number of trays in the warehouse, and also lists
the exact number of trays that are empty.

Whenever a (valid) change is made to any of these zones and bays, the
page will be refreshed accordingly to display the changes.

There are various types of changes and actions that you can perform to
the zones and bays, as follows.

Actions to Perform
------------------

1. A zone can be added by selecting the button on the far right and
   entering valid data into the dropdowns. Zone names must be unique.

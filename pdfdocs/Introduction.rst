Installation
------------

This section walks you through how to install and host the necessary
components of the system so that it can be used in production. The four
components are the front end, the back end, the database, and
authentication. Each component has its relevant subsection with
instructions on installation and deployment. Where relevant, there are
links directing to outside documentation that will aid you in this
process.

User Interface Walkaround
-------------------------

With the system up and running, this section will guide you through on
how to use the system and its key functions. Each step is accompained by
pictures to aid you in using the system.

System Overview
---------------

This section provides a quick overview of the two main parts of the
system - the front end and back end. This section adds context to the
rest of the document, which delves into the more technical aspects of
the system.

Developer
---------

This is where the API documentation for the backend is described. Every
function in the backend is split into three categories: tray functions,
bay functions, and zone functions. Each function documentation describes
the API URL, the input it receives, the parameters it requires, and the
output it provides.

Expansion
---------

| Should you wish to develop the system further, the Expansion section
  details the structure of the back end functions, as well as
  information on adding to the database, and authentication.
| **It is recommended that someone with development experience works on
  expansion of the system.**

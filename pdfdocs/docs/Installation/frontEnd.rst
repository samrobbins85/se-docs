Frontend
=========================================================



In our handover there is a folder named ``frontend``, in this is stored
the user interface with the program. It is a react app, and can be
started with the command ``npm install`` followed by ``npm start``, you
will then be taken to a browser window with the application loaded.

Note that the frontend and backend should be run in separate terminal windows.


Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code can be deployed using any static hosting, our
recommendation is `ZEIT Now <https://zeit.co/>`__ as they have a very
generous free tier and it is very easy to get set up. There are two main
ways of getting set up

Git Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*If you donâ€™t know what this is, then proceed to the other option.*

For continuous development, this is a better option as any changes you
make will be automatically deployed to the website.

This can be done in 3 steps

1. Add the files to a GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket repository
2. Create an account `here <https://zeit.co/signup>`__
3. Link together the repository and ZEIT by clicking ``Import Project``

Command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Install npm using the instructions
   `here <https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm>`__
2. Create a ZEIT account `here <https://zeit.co/signup>`__
3. Install the Now CLI using the instructions
   `here <https://zeit.co/download>`__
4. The code can then be deployed with the command ``now``, as documented
   `here <https://zeit.co/docs/v2/platform/deployments#now-cli>`__

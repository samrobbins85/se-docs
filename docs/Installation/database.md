For this application to run it also needs a database set up, for this we have chosen [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Deployment
Our recommendation for deployment is to use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) this has a free tier but allows for scaling up to a paid plan if your requirements exceed the limits of the free tier.

To get started sign up [here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) then choose any of the cloud providers, and select a local cluster with a free tier

Once this is done, a particular structure of the database will need to be estabilished if you don't want to change the code

1. Create a database named `foodbank`
2. Create 4 collections, `bays`, `dummy`, `food` and `zones` in that database

If you do want to change the names of the database or collections, please consult the expansion section of this user guide.

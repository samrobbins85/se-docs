   -  you can filter this snapshot to only show trays that contain a
      desired category by choosing it from the drop down menu in

2. You can export the full database of trays at this point in time into
   a CSV file and download it.

   -  You can do this by clicking ``Export`` in ``Control Panel 2``.

3. You can save the snapshot of the warehouse on the server for
   guaranteed future access, by clicking ``Publish`` in
   ``Control Panel 3``.

   -  This cannot by reversed, so only publish if and when it is
      absolutely necessary to do so, e.g.Â on a weekly basis after stock
      is taken.

4. You can download published reports in a csv format by selecting the
   report that was published from the dropdown list in
   ``Control panel 4`` and clicking the ``Download`` button in
